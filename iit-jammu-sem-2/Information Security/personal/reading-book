Two more definitions are worthy of note. An encryption scheme is
"unconditionally secure" if the ciphertext generated by the scheme does not con-
tain enough information to determine uniquely the corresponding plaintext, no
matter how much ciphertext is available. That is, no matter how much time an
opponent has, it is impossible for him or her to decrypt the ciphertext simply
because the required information is not there. 

With the exception of a scheme
known as the one-time pad (described later in this chapter), there is no encryp-
tion algorithm that is unconditionally secure. Therefore, all that the users of an
encryption algorithm can strive for is an algorithm that meets one or both of the
following criteria:
• The cost of breaking the cipher exceeds the value of the encrypted information.
• The time required to break the cipher exceeds the useful lifetime of the
information.
An encryption scheme is said to be computationally secure if either of the
foregoing two criteria are met. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to estimate the
amount of effort required to cryptanalyze ciphertext successfully.
