Block Cipher - an encryption/decryption scheme in which a block of plaintext is treated
            as a whole and used to produce a ciphertext block of equal length.

Many block ciphers have a Feistal structure.
- such a structure consists of a number of identical rounds of processing.

Stream Cipher - encrypts Data Stream 1 bit or 1 Byte at a time.

NOTE: Examples of classical stream ciphers are the autokeyed Vigen√®re cipher and the
Vernam cipher. In the ideal case, a one-time pad version of the Vernam cipher would
be used (Figure 2.7), in which the keystream is as long as the plaintext bit stream
. 

 for practical reasons, the bit-stream generator must be imple-
mented as an algorithmic procedure,
the bit-stream generator is a
key-controlled algorithm and must produce a bit stream that is cryptographically
strong. Now, the two users need only share the generating key, and each can produce
the keystream.

Block cipher - a block of plaintext is treated as whole, 
                and used to produce a cipher text block of equal length

Fiestal Cipher - proposed that we can approximate the ideal block cipher by utilizing the concept of a product 
                cipher, which is the execution of two or more simple ciphers in sequence in such a way
                that the final result or product is cryptographically stronger in sequence in such a way
                that the final result or product is cryptographically stronger than any of the component ciphers.
