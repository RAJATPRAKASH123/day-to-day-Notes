Discussion on Certificate Authority(CA)

We usually go to Intermediate CA, and it already mp 
root signed.

If hash matches, it doesn't have to fetch the certificate from root again, and can directly use the public key.

no government envolvement in the CA, 

in case of root certificate, it is self signed. i.e. signed by its own private key.

PKI - Public Key Infrastructure.

even if certificate is valid, browser will start showing certificate is invalid.

netscape navigator - first commercial browser

perfect forward secrecy - TLS 1.3 came in 2017

Socket Programming???

- Secure socket : whenever it takes the piece of info, it first encrypts it.

OS manages the Transport Layer
Application(like chrome) will manage TLS

TLS can be applied anywhere - 

Web PKI?

facebook.com and facebook.in are separate domains

X.509 are standard for public key certificate.

use "openssl" to see the binary or base64 certificate data in beautiful way.

certificate representation formats : 
- PEM
- DER
- PKCS#7
- PKCS#12

Even you provide the browser the root certificate, it won't trust you and go via its own trust chain of intermediary CA
