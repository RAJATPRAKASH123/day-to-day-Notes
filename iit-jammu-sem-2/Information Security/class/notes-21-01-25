one time pad -> very secure but problem 
    1. Practical problem of generating large keys frequently
    2. Key size

DES 


SPN - Substitution Permutation Network - or Product Cipher

Fistal          vs       SPN
   |                      |
half size             full size


Product Cipher : combination of permutation and combination for multiple round

Diffusion - set of characters of plaintext affect one of the character of ciphertext???
Confusion - 


Base of Transposition/Permutation

Rail Fence technique --
- if hacker knows the algorithm, brute force approach of depth and using NLP engine will be required.
- better let's try using frequency analysis, as the alphabets are same.




Substitution box given, permutation box also given.

as key is getting fused in every round, even you know the algorithm, it doesn't help.


# Steganography 

easy to check whether an image contains a message or not. 
- LSB decoder is there which can simply check the message.
- limitation : bigger size will make the image suspicious.


proprietary stegnography based algorithm are difficult.

one time pad - symmetric ....

des and aes - symmetric block ciphers

symmetric cipher depends upon either 1. feistal cipher structure or 2. substituitno/permutatiton


1. Feistal Cipher : 

half of data


Block cipher : take b bit...

Motivation for Feistal Cipher -

you have to do reversible mapping - Substitution 

let's go with based substituion
