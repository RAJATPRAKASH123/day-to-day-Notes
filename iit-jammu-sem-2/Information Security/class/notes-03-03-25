 Diffie Hellman - 1976

 Working on Problem like - symmetric key exchange 

RSA - key exchange
- choose a random value : r

r ^ e mod N

e, N <- Public Parameters --- X.509

(r ^ e mod N) ^ d


What Diffie Hellman suggest :
Choose P : large prime

Generator : g 
  - primitive root modulo p 
      -- any g from 1 to p-1
          -- g^1, g^2, ... g^phi(P) mod P
          = co primes to P

Below A, B using DH, both knowing (g, P)

(g, P)                                    (g, P)
-- A --                                   -- B --
a1 - private key of A             b1 - private key of B
(g ^ a1) mod P -- Pub1            (g ^ b1) mod P -- Pub2


-----------------------(g ^ b1 mod P)^a1  ----------->
               <--------------- Pub2  -----------

On using brute force, we can see it is a Discrete Logarithm Problem.
Put Modulus on Logarithm Problem, it will become Discrete Logarithm Problem.

DH algorithm only used for Key Exchange.

vulnerability with DH???

- Man in the middle attack

    A      --- g^a mod P --------------->      B
                (T) 
         
k1 = g^at mod P
k2 = g^bt mod P

by sending g^t mod P by man in the middle

- Biggest problem : Authentication
    - 3 ways to solve this problem - 
      1.cipher suits ?
      2. 
      3. Digital signature

      - ex - cipher suits in TLS 
    ways in which we can solve the problem : 
      - have a master secret.
      - 

Diffie HEllman only talks about Key exchange algo.

discuss on bluetooth -- uses Diffie Hellman algo.(on pairing)

Better algorithms are there in 

bluetooth can be cracked using - man in the middle

ECDH(E) is Epharmal... key is short lived

NOTE : RSA DOES NOT HAVE FORWARD SECRECY.

Similar g , a generator that generates all the point on elliptic curve

- addition of two points on eliptic curve. Why????
