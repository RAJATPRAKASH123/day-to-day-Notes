Symmetric Key Exchange using Assymetric
----------------------------------------


A has public key of B
B has public key of A

In that case how will they do session key exchange???

If A and B have key pairs based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
 or standard Diffie-Hellman (DH), they can perform a key exchange as follows:


you can use time instead of Nonce. 
Nonce, when you need challenge response.

TLS 1.3 - 1RTT me share ho jate h

Certificate authority - bind public key + identity

challenge response on sites - ask for hash, so only admin can upload file

highest level of trust at : root level.

SMTPS - SMTP over TLS

google is now root Certificate authority.
