can become an admin 
several mechanisms - 

what is Priviledge Escalation?

if you see website is returning a "role"
--real life example :  hpc booking facility 

same role goes to server, just change the role from client side
and become 'faculty'

it all happens due to bad designing.

we will see priviledge escalation in linux - 

whereis passwd

usr/bin contains the binary i.e. executable

color of files denote which type of they are

red color for some file like
gpasswd
psedo
fusermount
cshh
passwd

Why red? 

ls -l passwd

-rwsr -xr -x 1 root root 59976 Feb 6 2024 passwd 

Why 's' in above?

the OS takes out the effective user ID, 

setuid programs.

id tells what are the power of the user,

G -- executing apt -- 1000 id
r -- executing apt -- 0(as it is set uid program)

Effective UID <--- inherited from UUID

In case of set UID program, 
owner of apt will execute it (i.e. power of owner will be power of apt program)


why normal user create a set uid progarm?
- to limit/escalate the program access to resources

chmod u+s hashesh 

ls -l hashesh 

gedit setuidprogram.c 

--- setuidprogram.c ---
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){
    setuid(0);
    system("apt update");
    system("apt upgrade -y");
    return 0;
}
-----------------------

upd - in commandline 

apt update???

c will run effective user id of root, then c program will run 

in above code, the setuid will become 0, only possible to change setuid 
if you are acting as root

pass injection :: 

relative path in execution. 

If we do not provide absolute path, what happens?
Ans - We know about Environment Variables,
        OS looks into path variable
        Default way, OS look 0 to 100 path variables.

echo $PATH 

developer didn't put path in setuidprogram.c

- one way is to make file setuid, by becoming a root.

user executed -- setuid program -- setuidprogram me -- user tha, ---- jiske paas PATH tha

user ko pta chal gyaa ki setuid program chal rha, user can change the path variable
 to HOME_GAURAV

 In home/gaurav, he created a file apt , n usme likh diya (/bin/sh)

 ab esne kra executed, n means power badhaa di, pseudo apt 

now, this is priviledge escalation.

user ne interrupt kr diya, by calling its own program.

gcc setuidprogram.c
ls -l ./a.out
./a.out 
--- apt update nhi chlega, bcoz root hi chlaa skta hai apt update.
su 

root user ho gyaa
./a.out

let's khrab krte hain

echo $PATH 
/usr/local/games:/snap/

---- apt ---
yahaan kyy likha tha?? ek line me bss simple sa program tha
------------

ls -l apt 

let's change path variable, taaki usr bin me search na ho,
rather apne path pr ho

PATH = PATH=/home/gauravcdp/passwordcrackinghashcat:$PATH 

echo $PATH ./a.out

gedit

chown root setuidprogram.c 
chmod u+s setuidprogram.c 

ls -l ./a.out 

./a.out 


ab setuid bnaate h 
chmod u+s ./a.out 

ls -l ./a.out 

./a.out

su gauravcdp 

echo $PATH 

PATH=/home/gauravcdp/passwrod... :$PATH 

id 

let's do priviledge escalation : 

id 

ls -l ./a.out
