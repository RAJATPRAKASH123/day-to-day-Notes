what are different problems with public announcement?
public key authority?

typical size of certificate - 1200 to 

- self - signed certificate generation.
- csr first create then create certificate.
- one of us become a CA, others become entity
		- then end identity
		- question on trust???

we don't use static tokens because we have a well
known vulnerability :


csrf - one of the important vulnerability




* Security Mechanisms : CIA 

* Basic of Encryption - 
1. substition 
2. transposition
3. combination of above
4. steganography

* Fiestal cipher structure

* DES

*SPN : Subs. Permutation Network

* Permutation : 
	How AES works

* Problem of Key Exchange
  - Asymmetric can solve it.

* How public key shared?
* Certificate authorites
* HTTPS 
* Web PKI

* In WEB PKI - we understand Z.509 cert
*CRL - Certificate Revocation List
* TLS - 
	TLS Handshake
	RSA working and proves?
	How RSA uses above?


Conceptual question from AES, DES???




ECDH(E) is Epharmal... key is short lived
