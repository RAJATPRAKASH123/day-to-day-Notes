Feistal said we can have a key length of k bits and a block length of n bits, 
Which helped in future for the idea of SPN

* Diffusion : statistical structure ....

problem it is solving : patterns of plaintext in ciphertext

yn depends on all i letters from i to k.
i.e. so many plaintext letter are calculaing 1 cipher text

Diffusion => letter frequency will be more distributed.

In case of block cipher, distribution is achieved via permuations and 
then applying a function and then repeating the same process ...


    

* Confusion : using complex substituion algorithm

problem it is solving - patterns of key in ciphertext can be cryptanalyzed.

NIST recognized Fiestel and known as DES and was standard encryption.
Further, it was breaked in 1999 in 10 hours.

So, now DES in not recognized.

NOTE : Learn working of Fiestal via example in book.

-- the file is divided into multiple blocks
-- every block is 128 bits...


block size increases => diffusion increases
bigger block => more computation
key size increases => confusion increases and brute force increases
more rounds => more complex cipher
subkey generation algo => 

:: DES  ::

3 times DES gives 128 bits, it was also sufficiently strong

expanision permutation , which can expand the permutation.


Question : Perform the Encryption 
        # XBoxes...


how to assess randomness?
whether its one round or two, how can we prove how much more randomness got 
introduced in second round??? - Ask Sayantan Sir
