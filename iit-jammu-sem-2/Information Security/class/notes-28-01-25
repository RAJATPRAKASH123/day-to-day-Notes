Revise Feistal Cipher
Task : understand permutation, expansion permutation,
       what is the size of key(x) --expansion to --> 56 bits
       divide into two 28 + 28, then ... then xor ...
       block size : 64

General Structure of DES : 

NOTE : Whenever we talk about TLS, AES comes

AES works on plaintext block of 128

Substitute Bytes
shiftRows
MixColumns
AddRoundKey (- a xor operation ,  subkey generated)

i.e. every round has a new key

A word is 4 bytes here in DES.

Extension Field -- EA

g is comprised of : 
1. RotWord : B0, B1, B2, B3 --> B1, B2, B3, B0
2. Subword : using S-Box 
3. get Rcon[j] , then do xor


4th word goes to function g
