Threat Modeling ::

Pentesting or Penetration Testing? -- after product development.

Threat Modeling? -- pre or during product development.

Pentesting VS Threat Modeling

NOTE : Before development of Software, we can't do Pentesting

BlackBox Pentesting vs GreyBox Pentesting vs WhiteBox Pentesting  

Worksuit - have tool for Pentesting...

Threat Modeling - Security Analysis during product development which adds security during and after product development

Most security concepts are Application Independent.

Data Flow Diagram - 
                          
|Admin|    |API|
                                ___________

                                ~~~~~~~~~~~

STRIDE Model :
Spoofing - Implement MFA(Multi Factor Authentication) on logging page
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
DoS
Escalation of Priviledge

DREAD RISK Model : A risk assessment model
Damage Potential
Reproducibility
Exploitability
Affected Users
Discoverability

Store the hash of post/user - to prove where it belongs or who had created the post
        -- Repudiation

discoverability - leave system open to everyone. How easy/tough is to discover the threat?

(D + R + E + A + D)/5 

Minimum Security Requirements???

Active MITM -- Spoofing

DFD terms :
Rectangular Box - Entity [Source or Sink of Data]
Oval or Circular - Process in DFD
                        - Security of data at Rest [i.e. in db]
Data Flow???

strcpy - not a safe function {depreceated and it introduces buffer overflow}
