latency    : time needed to complete one operation.
throughput : number of operations performed per unit time.

reln. : 
    improving latency, improves throughput 
    improving throughput doesn't affect latency 

parallel algo : 
    written for 2 or more processor but can even work with 1 processor 

PRAM : 
    p processors
    all accessing sharing RAM 
    synchronous : all processor running with single clock
    each processor is exactlly like a random access machine, that can 
        run sequential algorithm
    each processor has unique id from some range e.g., [1...p]
        just a convention, you can take 0...p-1 too

- Collection of numbered processors.
- Each processor accesses shared memory cells
- Each processor can access any shared memory cell in unit time (same
    time for all processors).
- Inputs are stored in shared memory cells, outputs also need to be
    stored in the shared memory
- Each processor can have local memory (and/or registers) - but those
    are used only for storing data for one instruction only.
- The Shared RAM has unbounded number of local memory cells.
- Each memory cell can hold an integer / data of unbounded size.
- The instruction set includes operations for: moving data,
    comparisons, branching, arithmetic and logical operations.
- Execution starts at the first instruction of the program and terminates
    when the last instruction is done.
- Each operation takes one time unit. 

## ?3-phases of instruction processing (model) in PRAM
1 Read (if any) from a shared memory cell
2 Execute / Compute / Local computation (if any)
3 Write (if any) to a shared memory cell

NOTE : All Processors execute these 3-phase of a PRAM instruction
synchronously

This is a must.

-------------------------
Phase Synchronization
-------------------------

All phases are fully synchronized
It means if P0 is doing read, p1 is also doing the read, and all the
other processors are doing the read operation only
## A phase might be idle for a processor but but the processor can’t do any other operation.#
Also, all reading location maybe different.

:: PRAM - Shared Memory Access Mechanism ::

If hardware (Memory architecture / controller) can permit - reading
multiple locations simultaneously - that’s all the model needs.
