: Parallel Solution : Ideally Two Ways for High Performance
- Work/Functional/Task Partitioning:
  Different Processors executing different tasks
- Domain/Data Decompostion:
  Different Processors solving same global task on smaller subsets

: What is a computer? :
- Von Neumann Architecture
  CPU : Process instrns.
    - Register
    - ALU
    - Control Unit
  Memory / RAM : stores Data & Instructions
    - memory is "flat" consecutive locations
    - access on any location has always the same cost
  One CPU , One Memory & One Input/Output units:

: Assumptions in Algorithm Design : 
- 1 instruction/unit time
- Access to memory has same cost as any other Arithmetic/Logic opern.

NOTE : Processor Performance scaling has reached its Limits

: Concept of Multiple Processors : 

Multiprocessing : multiple processors working together
                  - same chip or across different chips

on same chip : chip multi-processor(CMP) or 'core'
on same board(Motherboard): 
  - may share same memory
  - may exchange data via message passing via (preferably, synchronous) 
    communication systems.


: Computer Cluster - Page 1 :
What is a computer cluster?
- Set of computers working together can be viewed as a single system.
- Each node may perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.

: Components & Working prniciples :
- Each node(computer as a server) running its own instance of an operating system.
- nodes use the same hardware and the same OS.
- The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast
local area networks.
- Possible to have different hardware and OSs.

Usages - Advantages
* Usually deployed to improve performance and availability.
* Much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability.

Some Important Terms - Single & Multi-User Systems

Single-User system 
------------------
A system that allows only one user to perform task.
Single User system can be Single-Tasking or Multi-Tasking.

* Single User/Single Tasking : 

* Single User/Multi Tasking : 

* Multi User :

: Symmetric vs Asymmetric MULTIPROCESSING... : 

Symmetric processsing : All machines are considered equal.
Asymmetric processing : All machines are not considered equal.

Symmetric Multiprocessors : All processors are same.
                            All consituent processing elements are same.

Hybrid computing : System that has more than one kind of processors or cores.

Strong vs Loosely Coupled Multiprocessing : 

Loosely coupled multiprocessing : running multiple unrelated programs in parallel on a multiprocessor.
Strongly coupled multiprocessing : running a set of programs in parallel that share
                                   their data, code, file and network connections.

Shared Memory : All the programs share the virtual address space.
Message Passing : Programs communicate between each other by sending and 
                  receiving messages. Do not share memory addresses.

Parallel Processing : same clock & control.
- Parallel Architecture
- Parallel Algorithms 

Distributed Systems and Processing : 
- Not colocated
- No common clock & control
- All machines are somehow independent, but all are participating for a common goal

Distributed System Architecture : ??
- How various machines are connected & OS on top of it.
- How are they communicating? Invoking methods from one machine to another and so on.

Distributed Computing :
- Algorithms required to build and maintain distributed architecture and environment.
- Maintaining concurrency of components, overcoming the lack of global clock.
- All communication related algorithms
- Providing mutual exclusions, leader election, coming up with concensus decision.
- Algorithms for fault-tolerant execution.

Distributed Algorithms : 
  Precondition -
    - Distributed system already in place.
    - We are trying to write (Applications) algorithms which can use this distributed
      system to solve problems.
    - We assume underlying distributed system provides fault-free communication, mutual exculsions.

  Contents -
    - Algorithms may depend upon timing behaviour of various machines.
      asynchronous, synchronous, semi-synchronous
    - Graph algorithms for Large graphs
    - Sorting algorithms for data distributed over multiple systems

Fault Tolerant Computing :
Fault tolerance refers to ability of a system(computer, network, cloud, cluster, etc)
to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail. 
 - multiple processors are NOT used for high-performance, but used to achieve 
   correct result regardless of faults in the system.
 - objective - improve reliability using multiple systems.

              :: Flynn's Taxonomy :

Flynn's Classification :
* Instruction Stream : Set of instructions to be executed.
* Data Stream : Set of Data values.

Conceptually 4 types of multiprocessors :
_______________
| SISD | SIMD |
| MISD | MIMD |
---------------

SISD : 
  - standard uniprocessor
  - Just Von Neumann Architecture
  - No multiprocessing opportunity

SIMD : 
  - One instruction operates on multiple pieces of data.
  - Vector processors have one instruction that operates on many pieces of data in parallel.
  - Example, one instruction(say, sqr) can compute the square of 4 values in parallel.

MISD :
  - Not used for high performance
  - Used for safety-critical/ fault tolerant/ high-precision systems.
  - Usage
