: Parallel Solution : Ideally Two Ways for High Performance
- Work/Functional/Task Partitioning:
  Different Processors executing different tasks
- Domain/Data Decompostion:
  Different Processors solving same global task on smaller subsets

: What is a computer? :
- Von Neumann Architecture
  CPU : Process instrns.
    - Register
    - ALU
    - Control Unit
  Memory / RAM : stores Data & Instructions
    - memory is "flat" consecutive locations
    - access on any location has always the same cost
  One CPU , One Memory & One Input/Output units:

: Assumptions in Algorithm Design : 
- 1 instruction/unit time
- Access to memory has same cost as any other Arithmetic/Logic opern.

NOTE : Processor Performance scaling has reached its Limits

: Concept of Multiple Processors : 

Multiprocessing : multiple processors working together
                  - same chip or across different chips

on same chip : chip multi-processor(CMP) or 'core'
on same board(Motherboard): 
  - may share same memory
  - may exchange data via message passing via (preferably, synchronous) 
    communication systems.


: Computer Cluster - Page 1 :
What is a computer cluster?
- Set of computers working together can be viewed as a single system.
- Each node may perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.

: Components & Working principles :
- Each node(computer as a server) running its own instance of an operating system.
- nodes use the same hardware and the same OS.
- The components of a cluster are usually connected to each other through fast
local area networks.
- Possible to have different hardware and OSs.

Usages - Advantages
* Usually deployed to improve performance and availability.
* Much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability.

Some Important Terms - Single & Multi-User Systems

Single-User system 
------------------
A system that allows only one user to perform task.
Single User system can be Single-Tasking or Multi-Tasking.

* Single User/Single Tasking : 

* Single User/Multi Tasking : 

* Multi User :

: Symmetric vs Asymmetric MULTIPROCESSING... : 

Symmetric processsing : All machines are considered equal.
Asymmetric processing : All machines are not considered equal.

Symmetric Multiprocessors : All processors are same.
                            All consituent processing elements are same.

Hybrid computing : System that has more than one kind of processors or cores.

Strong vs Loosely Coupled Multiprocessing : 

Loosely coupled multiprocessing : running multiple unrelated programs in parallel on a multiprocessor.
Strongly coupled multiprocessing : running a set of programs in parallel that share
                                   their data, code, file and network connections.

Shared Memory : All the programs share the virtual address space.
Message Passing : Programs communicate between each other by sending and 
                  receiving messages. Do not share memory addresses.

Parallel Processing : same clock & control.
- Parallel Architecture
- Parallel Algorithms 

Distributed Systems and Processing : 
- Not colocated
- No common clock & control
- All machines are somehow independent, but all are participating for a common goal

Distributed System Architecture : ??
- How various machines are connected & OS on top of it.
- How are they communicating? Invoking methods from one machine to another and so on.

Distributed Computing :
- Algorithms required to build and maintain distributed architecture and environment.
- Maintaining concurrency of components, overcoming the lack of global clock.
- All communication related algorithms
- Providing mutual exclusions, leader election, coming up with concensus decision.
- Algorithms for fault-tolerant execution.

Distributed Algorithms : 
  Precondition - 
    - Distributed system already in place. 
    - We are trying to write (Applications) algorithms which can use this distributed 
      system to solve problems. 
    - We assume underlying distributed system provides fault-free communication, mutual exclusions. 

  Contents -
    - Algorithms may depend upon timing behaviour of various machines.
      asynchronous, synchronous, semi-synchronous
    - Graph algorithms for Large graphs
    - Sorting algorithms for data distributed over multiple systems

Fault Tolerant Computing :
Fault tolerance refers to ability of a system(computer, network, cloud, cluster, etc)
to continue operating without interruption when one or more of its components fail. 
 - multiple processors are NOT used for high-performance, but used to achieve 
   correct result regardless of faults in the system.
 - objective - improve reliability using multiple systems.

              :: Flynn's Taxonomy :

Flynn's Classification :
* Instruction Stream : Set of instructions to be executed.
* Data Stream : Set of Data values.

Conceptually 4 types of multiprocessors :
_______________
| SISD | SIMD |
| MISD | MIMD |
---------------

SISD : 
  - standard uniprocessor
  - Just Von Neumann Architecture
  - No multiprocessing opportunity

SIMD : 
  - One instruction operates on multiple pieces of data.
  - Vector processors have one instruction that operates on many pieces of data in parallel.
  - Example, one instruction(say, sqr) can compute the square of 4 values in parallel.

MISD :
  - Not used for high performance
  - Used for safety-critical/ fault tolerant/ high-precision systems.
  - Usage :
    - An aircraft with an AMD, an ARM and an INTEL X86 processor
    - final outcome is decided on the basis of majority vote
  
MIMD : Instruction Pool
  
  D          |         |
  A --> PU <-|->  PU <-|
  T          |         |
  A --> PU <-|->  PU <-|
    
  P
  O
  O
  L

Variation on MIMD -
1. SPMD / Single Program Multiple Data
  - Typically multiple processes or threads executing
    the same program with different inputs.
  Ex - pthread, OpenMP, MPI program

2. MPMD / Multiple Programs Multiple Data
  - Different programs run on different machines 
  - Usually, a master program and multiple instances of 
    slave (also called as worker) programs
  - Master delegates work to slaves
  - Master monitors & control slaves, assign tasks, 
    aborting slaves, etc.
  - Possibility of more than one master program, 
    and also other kind organization

Performance - 
Depends on the response time, throughput and execution time of a computer system.

Response Time/ Wall-time : 
- time from start to completion of a task.
- also includes :
  - OS overhead.
  - Waiting for I/O and other processes.
  - Accessing disk and memory.
  - Time spent executing on the CPU or execution time.
  - Throughput is the total amount of work done in given time.

: Execution time and Performance :
Execution time is the total time a CPU spends computing
on a given task 
* It excludes time for I/O or running other programs.


* Execution time : Total time a CPU spends computing on a given task.
  - It excludes time for I/O or running other programs.
  - This is also referred to as simply CPU time.

Performance = 1/ Execution Time


* With only one processor (computing unit)
  - Response time >= Execution time
  - If (Response time == Execution time ){
    no OS overhead, 
    no I/O waiting,
    no other process has put any overhead in the system.
  }


* With Multiple Processors( Computing units)
- Objective : Response time << Execution time
- Execution is supposed to be distributed in some way to 
  multiple processing units - such that the task finishes in less time.
- If (Response time == Execution time 
means some or all of these {
  No practical benefit of using multiple processors,
  various overheads(OS/IO) delaying task completion,
  Other tasks running on the system may have put overhead
}


How much benefit can we get using multiple processors??
- Need to do Performance Comparison. 
- Amdahl's Law

:: Quantification & Definitions::
* Enhancement : It is any change/ modification in the design and realization of component. % of enhancement
fE

* Factor of Improvement : It is a ratio that implies the scale of improvement - fI

* Speed-up (S) : It is a measure that tells us how much
  faster a task will run using the enhanced version of code/machine as opposed to the original machine.
  S = Runtime with enhancement/ Runtime without enhancement
  


Processor A is faster than processor B 

:: Amdahl's Law ::
- a mathematical expression used to find the maximum expected improvement to an overall system when only part of the system is improved/enhanced/running in parallel.
- It is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speed-up using multiple processors.
- For P parallel processors, we can expect a speedup of P(ideal case)
- In practice, we get speed-up <= P because:
  - there are dependencies among instructions/ lines of code
  - dependent instructions must follow/run in order
  - enhanced feature may not be used all the time.
  - maximum number of concurrent instructions (run in parallel) is <= P
  - more that one memory locations are read simultaneously (in
    one clock cycle) by by 1 processor, or multiple processors

Exclusivve Read & Concurrent Read

----
Exclusive Read (ER): no two processors are allowed to read the
same shared memory cell / location / address simultaneously.
Concurrent Read (CR): Simultaneous read by multiple processors
(including all processors) to the same shared memory location are
allowed.
----

No consistency issue in ER or CR
There is no consistency issue with the read (either ER or CR).

----

No consistency issue in ER or CR

Can we write two memory locations simultaneously?
▶ Perhaps YES - if the hardware (Memory architecture / controller)
permits.
Can we write the same memory location by two or more processors
simultaneously?
▶ NO - What will be the result? Consistency issue.
▶ What if all processors want to write the same value - then No Issue.


Let's discuss : Exclusive Read & Concurrent Write
                ER-CW

## Concurrent Write [CW] Variations -

Various methods are used to resolve conflict among the contending
processors trying to write same memory location.

1. Priority based resolution, or, Priority Concurrent Write.
▶ Processors are assigned with priorities
2. Arbitrary/Random resolution, or, Arbitrary Concurrent Write
▶ one randomly chosen write wins
3. Common/Same value writing by multiple processors (Common
▶ Processors are trying to write same value to a memory location.

NOTE : Real memory (computer) system can imitate partially to Common
CW model - at the best.

:: Find an Item in an array ::

Objective - 

We will solve this problem for various PRAM models.
Item may appear one or multiple times
Items may be present in unsorted or sorted in the Array

return - true/false if present or absent
       - first/last/any index where x is present


Find x in an unsorted A[]

-- Sequential solution is trivial
  - take an index = -1, keep updating until it reaches the result
  - return false, if index == -1 else return true

int low = 0, high = n-1

while (low != high):
  m = low + (high - low)//2
  if x == arr[m]:
    return m
  else if x > arr[m]:
    low = m + 1
  else:
    high = m - 1
  

The cost of Sequential algorithm and parallel algorithm in an unsorted array is 
the same. -- cost optimality???


      ## Find Item : Unsorted Array ##

## Find x in Unsorted Array A[] without Duplicate - P1

So, -- All processors are able to write true in one place when if x is present in 
       array because x can be present at only one place.
