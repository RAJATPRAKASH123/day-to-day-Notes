You have to make sure that, you should not use concurrent write.
Although, we are doing parallel programming, you are not writing all of them in parallel.
So, be selective and choose wisely for parallel programming.


Amdahl's Law :


Discussed speed-ups

don't use barrier, don't use single..., use them as less as possible.

NOTE : we should try making most of the code efficient...

HW : solve the problems in the slides


while a < 0 is better than while a == -1 ( Reason : Assembly )

Optimal number of processors for summing an array : log n or n/log 

We should solve the problem for all PRAM models.


We can find the minimum in the tree like processing : so log n time 

finding cost optimality but not reaching at the result??? - sir

Q : Missing and Duplicate values question.
- need to use bitwise operator(usually associative ones)


Brent's Scheduing Principle - not important for course

puchi :)
