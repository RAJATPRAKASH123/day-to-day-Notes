In terms of CPU - we say ALU - which contains lot of sophisticated functions.

heterogenous computing : 
    - 

NOTE : No I/O in GPUs.

OpenCL - for any kind of co-processor. i.e. GPGPU is one kind of co-processor.

But, CUDA C/C++ is beating everyone when it comes to GPGPU executions.

Basic philosophy of GPGPU Programming : 
....

When writin code/designing...
host : CPU
device: GPU  [ Putting multiple ... ]

Video RAM - VRAM - also a DRAM . Where objective is scanning facility is easy.

Fragmented RAM... Not a single memory.

Networking course - Blocking read from socket/ Non-blocking read from socket

How device knows some task is finished? - by handshaking

synchronous means you will get acknowledgment
in asynchronous, you don't know...
