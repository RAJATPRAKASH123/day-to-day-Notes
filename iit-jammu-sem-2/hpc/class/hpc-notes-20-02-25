Transforming Vector Addition for CPU+GPU

vecAdd<<<1, n>>>            # 1 depends upon machine, we can take it as 1 for whole course

Kernel and CUDA calls are queued.

Neighbourhood sum :

threadIdx is a defined variable in CUDA. 

1, n --> Flat architecture

NOTE : Overwriting will happen, when we have 40 threads but 32 processors

syncthreads()  <--- similar to openMP

PRAM - every processor will do same instruction, 
      similarly in gpu we too...

:: NOTE ::
when left = 0 happening, 
    other processors are not doing anything...
