Problem : Find Maximum - CRCW, Using n^2 processors
NOR is all have to be False

take NOR for each row

To improve : Let's try Pointer Jump


If we are using array, why to use linkedlist?? 

in concurrent data structure

we are applying PRAM algorithm in linkedlist
              ____
_____________|___|__
|__|__|__|__|__|_______
        v        ^
        |--------|

As we are making linked list on array, we can simply use
next index instead of pointers.

In sequential time : O(n)

In parallel - n processors.
Everybody will be pointing to last node in - log(n)

Can I use this to find the rank of list, 
i.e. no. of nodes to the end of the list.
- sequential - using stack/recursion

how to do it in logn???
