Hashing is costly, 
main problem with Hashing is that if number is continuous hashing is very bad.

Sigma(*, 20) = {...all strings with <20 i.e. 2^20 }
--- in this case, no hash function in the world works in this case properly.
S << Sigma* then only hashing works.


In case of Finding duplicate : 
    if more than one processor, 

In exam : Cost optimal for the Find duplicate question??? in CW
