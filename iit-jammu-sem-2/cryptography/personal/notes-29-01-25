:: Section 2 :: Perfect Secrecy and Stream Ciphers

Modifying Shift Cipher(Restricted)

M = CT = {(x1, x2, ... xl): xi belongs to {0, 1}} <-> Z2 ^ l
Eki(xi) = (xi ⊕ ki)
Dki(yi) = (yi ⊕ ki)

Secure? 
  - YES, provided all ki are sampled uniformly at random.
  - i.e. Uncoditionally secure if all ki are sampled uniformly at random.

  E ∩ F = φ: E can’t happen if F. Strongly dependent.


Secrecy ? 
    - Given ct, it is hard to gather information about m
      even for an unbounded adversary

  Pr[m|ct] = Pr[m] ∀m ∈ M, ct ∈ Ct


      :: PRBG ::
    -------------
So, can we say PRBG random number is provably secure random number?
▶ Good: seed is much smaller than message.
▶ Not so Good: No perfect secrecy. Security of PRBG is important.
