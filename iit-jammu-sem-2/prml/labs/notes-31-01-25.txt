x :  i.e. heavy or light

w : class of fish i.e. salmon or seabass

p(x) : evidence

p(w) : prior probability

p(x | w) is given, bcoz it might be known by other experiments, generalized prob.

p(w | x) : we have to find, i.e. given this situation, what are the chances of 
            having heavy or light fish (might help pre-ordering Can for supply)
