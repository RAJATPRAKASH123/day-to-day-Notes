what is likelihood?

when I plot n samples : 

            ---o----o---o--o-....n-samples------->

Mixture density : composed of component densities.

P(X) = P(w1).N(mu1, sigma1) P(w2).N(mu2, sigma2)

last time when we did likelihood : 
- we only 

which combination of theta_1 + theta_1 ; I will get maximum likelihood for the entire distribution.

I am gonna write function of maximum likelihood.

If theta1 == theta2, 

... there should be uniqueness...

concept of loglikelihood???

Expectation maximization? 
        imp - every point i am calculating responsibility factor
                for each class.

x1 --- r11 responsibility of class 1 to class 2...
x2 ---

xn ---
