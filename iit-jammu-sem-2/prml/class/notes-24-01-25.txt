Conditional Risk

:: Minimum Error Rate Classification ::

* Given 'c' classes
* Action alpha_i is usually interpreted as the decision that the true state of nature is wi(predicted class).
* If action alpha_i is taken and the true state of nature is wj, then 
    - the decison is correct if  i == j, and in error i != j.
* Then so-called symmetrical or zezo-one loss function can be defined as ;
    R(alpha_i|x)= sigma of Lambda(alpha_i|w_j). P(w_j|x)
